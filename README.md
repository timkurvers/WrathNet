WrathNet
========

World of Warcraft client foundation written in JavaScript, enabling  
development of expansion-agnostic clients, bots and other useful tools.

Please note that this is the code behind the interface, or client itself. This is the equivalent to a command line or console, if you are not interested in developing you are most likely looking for the [sample client](https://github.com/timkurvers/wrathnet-client) project.

### This project is an experimental proof of concept covering the following ideas:
* An in-browser World of Warcraft client without reliance on external plugins.
* Experiments with 2D/3D world porting (Zelda like 2D four direction scrolling).
* A unofficial WoW client in itself that is able to be multi-version compatible.
* A text version of the client for testing the results of server development.
